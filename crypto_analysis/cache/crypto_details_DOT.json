{"name": "Polkadot", "symbol": "DOT", "description": "Polkadot is a platform that allows diverse blockchains to transfer messages, including value, in a trust-free fashion; sharing their unique features while pooling their security. In brief, Polkadot is a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain technology.\r\n\r\nPolkadot is heterogeneous because it is entirely flexible and makes no assumption about the nature or structure of the chains in the network. Even non-blockchain systems or data structures can become parachains if they fulfill a set of criteria.\r\n\r\nPolkadot may be considered equivalent to a set of independent chains (e.g. a set containing Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Namecoin and Bitcoin) except with important additions: pooled security and trust-free interchain transactability.\r\n\r\nMany of the native parachains of Polkadot will be written using a Polkadot Runtime Environment SDK (e.g. Parity Technologies' Substrate).", "image": "https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/12171/large/polkadot.png?1696512008", "current_price": 3.97, "market_cap": 6027273468, "total_volume": 279910812, "high_24h": 3.96, "low_24h": 3.79, "price_change_percentage_24h": 3.03109, "price_change_percentage_7d": -10.73391, "price_change_percentage_30d": 1.76974, "last_updated": "2025-09-26T17:37:49.754Z"}
