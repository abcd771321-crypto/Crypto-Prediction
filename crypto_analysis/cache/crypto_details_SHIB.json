{"name": "Shiba Inu", "symbol": "SHIB", "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme token which began as a fun currency and has now transformed into a decentralized ecosystem. During the initial\u00a0launch, 50% of the supply was allocated into Vitalik Buterin's ethereum wallet. \r\n\r\nAs a result of that, Vitalik proceeded to donate 10% of his SHIB holdings to a COVID-19 relief effort in India and the remaining 40% is burnt forever. That donation was worth about $1 billion at that time, which makes it one of the largest donation ever in the world.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Shiba Inu community working on right now? The Shiba Inu team launched a decentralized exchange called Shibaswap with 2 new tokens, LEASH and BONE. LEASH is a scarce supply token that is used to offer incentives on Shibaswap. BONE is the governance token for holders to vote on proposals on Doggy DAO.", "image": "https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/11939/large/shiba.png?1696511800", "current_price": 1.19e-05, "market_cap": 7009565142, "total_volume": 204407293, "high_24h": 1.191e-05, "low_24h": 1.154e-05, "price_change_percentage_24h": 2.13196, "price_change_percentage_7d": -8.19365, "price_change_percentage_30d": -5.23796, "last_updated": "2025-09-26T17:39:28.684Z"}
